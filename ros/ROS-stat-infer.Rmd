This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
# Generate a random binary dataset of length 100
binary_data <- sample(c(0, 1), size = 100, replace = TRUE)
y <- sum(binary_data == 1)
n <- sum(binary_data == 0)
print(y)
print(n)
```


```{r}
# qnorm returns quantity from standard normal at specified probability
# c(x,y) creates a vector 
# variance proportion = sqrt(p(1-p))
estimate <- y/n
se <- sqrt(estimate*(1-estimate)/n)
int_95 <- estimate + qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975))*se
print(int_95)
```


```{r}
n = 1000
n_man = 400
n_women = 600
p_women = 0.45
p_man = 0.57
se_men = sqrt(p_man * (1 - p_man) / n_man)
se_women = sqrt(p_women * (1 - p_women) / n_women)
se_total = sqrt(se_men ** 2 + se_women ** 2)
print(se_total)

```


```{r}
# In R, the qt() function is used to calculate quantiles from the Student's t-distribution

y = c(35,34,38,35,37)
n <- length(y)
estimate <- mean(y)
se <- sd(y)/sqrt(n)
int50 <- estimate + qt(c(0.25, 0.75), n-1)*se
print(int50)
```
